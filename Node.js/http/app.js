/**This code is using Node.js's built-in http module to make a GET request to the http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users API endpoint. The endpoint returns a list of users in JSON format.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

The code imports the http module using the require statement.

The http.get method is called with the API endpoint URL and a callback function that will be called when the response is received. The callback function takes a single argument, res, which is the response object.

The code creates an empty array, data, to store the response data.

The code checks the response headers to get the date of the response. If the date header is not present, the code sets a default value of "no response date".

The code logs the status code of the response and the date in the response header to the console.

The code sets up an event listener for the "data" event on the response object. When the "data" event is emitted, the code appends the received data to the data array.

The code sets up an event listener for the "end" event on the response object. When the "end" event is emitted, the code concatenates all the received data in the data array, converts it to a string, and parses it as JSON. It then loops through each user in the response and logs their ID and name to the console.

The code sets up an error event listener on the http request. If an error occurs, the error message is logged to the console.

Overall, this code makes an HTTP GET request to an API endpoint, receives a JSON response, parses it, and logs the data to the console. */
